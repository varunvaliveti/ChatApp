The formatting kind of not so good, but if you want to run on local do this:

run the 'runthis' executable file in your terminal, google it if you don't know how

once thats running the terminal should say "warming up", meaning you are good to run the frontend

to run the angular app run** ng serve**, it will run on port 4200
p.s. you need to have the angular cli tools
npm install -g @angular/cli
